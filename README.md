<h2 align="right">📚 Projects</h2>

Here are some of my projects done in studies:

### 📊 ASCII decoder / encoder (purely Go)

Simple console application that decodes and encodes ASCII characters within specific decoding methods.
This was two-part assignment where I created console application that decoded and encoded ASCII characters. On the second part I created web application that used the console application to decode and encode ASCII characters.

Key learning points:
- Encoding
- Parsing functional arguments
- HTML templates in Go

### 🚄 Pathfinding application (purely Go, group project)

Commandline tool that simulates the route planning and scheduling of multiple trains in a graph-based station network. The program finds efficient paths from origin to destination and calculates the optimal movement schedule, preventing collisions. Uses Breandth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms with some custom strategies.

Key learning poinst:
- Implement and optimize a path-finding algorithm for multi-train routing.
- Design and parse graph data structures from input files.
- Develop a robust command-line Go program with error handling.
- Solve constraints like single-occupancy stations and optimal multi-train paths.
- Optimize performance for large-scale networks.

### 🌐 Webforum (Go, html, css, sql, docker. group project)

Fully functional webforum application that allows users to create accounts, post messages, and interact with other users (likes/dislikes, comments, etc.). Features filtering, sorting, and pagination. Users can filter posts by category, created posts (for registered users), and liked posts (for registered users).

Key learning points:
- The basics of web development: HTML, HTTP, sessions, and cookies.
- Using and setting up Docker.
- SQL language and database manipulation.
- The basics of encryption.
- Docker essentials: Installation, configuration, image creation, container management, and best practices.
